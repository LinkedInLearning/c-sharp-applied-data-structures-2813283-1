	- .NET SDK, version 7
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. We suggest using Visual Studio Code as your editor, but any text editor will work

## Codespace
This course has been set up to use Codespaces, an online development environment that requires no installation. Fork a copy of the repository in your own Github account and use a Codespace to work entirely online.

### Instructor
